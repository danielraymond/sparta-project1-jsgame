          <h3>How to play:</h3>
          <div class="instructions">This game involves making decisions depending on the text the game presents you with.</div>
          <div class="instructions">First you need to set your health which you will find displayed in the top left of the screen. This is done by clicking a button when prompted.</div>
          <div class="instructions">Next the game will present you with a block of text and you must decide what to do based on the options given.</div>
          <div class="instructions">At some point in the game you will reach a combat scenario. To win you will need to click the button which rolls dice where the difference in values is equal to the damage either you or the enemy takes.</div>
