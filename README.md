# Knight's Quest

### The Game:

Knight's Quest is a text based game where you make decisions based on text that the game presents you with. The game involves combat with various enemies. It also includes events and items that effect the outcome of the game in different ways such as increasing health, damage and reducing the strength of enemies.

The game is designed to have a branching storyline with different outcomes and enemies and items you can collect. This is to make the game replay-able so that you can try to discover the various ways you can reach the end.

### Instructions:

The game is fairly simple in its function. The following is a basic description of the games function:
 1. Start the game with a button click.
 2. Set the player health with a random dice roll with a starting value of 10 plus a random number between 1 and 10.
 3. The game then presents you with a block of text and a set of decisions. You must make your decision based on what the game has told you however it is not always obvious what the right decision is.
 4. When the player is met with a combat event the player can click a button to attack. This produces a random number for the player and the enemy and the damage to either is the difference between the values.

### My task:

##### Requirements:

1. A branching storyline.
2. A combat system.
3. Items the user can pick up.
4. Restart options if the player wins or loses.
5. A health value that is changed when damage is taken and displayed on the screen.
6. Instruction and a story intro on the page.
7. A random function to generate user health at the beginning.

##### What I delivered:
I delivered on all of the above deliverables.

The deliverables I failed to deliver were:
1. Adding a more advanced combat system.
2. Having a display of the player's items.
3. A display at the end telling you what you did and what items you collected.

##### What I am most pleased with:

I am pleased with the size of the game and the number of locations, events and items there are.

##### What was the most challenging part:

I found coming up with a good method to get between parts of the story difficult as well as putting items into the game. I also found predicting how much time things would take difficult as I had plans to improve the game that could not be completed due to a lack of time.
